        <h3 class="SubHeader">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
	   <li>350g self-raising flour, and a little spare for dusting</li>
	   <li>½ tsp salt</li>
	   <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
	   <li>85g butter, cut into cubes</li>
	   <li>3 tsp sugar</li>
	   <li>175ml milk</li>
	   <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
	   <li>Squeeze lemon juice (see know-how below)</li>
	   <li>Egg, beaten, to glaze</li>
	   <li>Jam and whipped cream, to serve</li></ul>
      </div>
      <div class="HpwToMake">
        <h3 class="SubHeader">Method</h3>
        <ol class="MethodWrapper"><li>Preheat the oven to 220°C (or gas mark 7).

Tip the flour into a large bowl along with the salt and baking powder, then mix it all up.
Add the butter in, then rub the butter in with your fingers until the mix looks like fine crumbs.</li>
<li>Stir in the sugar.</li>
<li>Heat the milk in a jug in the microwave for about 20-30 seconds until warm, but not hot.</li>

<li>Add the vanilla and lemon juice to the milk, then set it aside.
Put a baking tray in the oven to warm.
Make a well in the dry mix, add the liquid, and combine quickly with a cutlery knife.</li>

<li>The dough will seem pretty wet at first.
Spread some flour onto the work surface and tip the dough out.
Dredge the dough and your hands with a little more flour, then fold the dough over 2-3 times until it’s smoother.
Pat the dough into a round shape about 4cm deep.</li>
<li>Cut the dough:

Take a 5cm cutter (Pro-tip – smooth-edged cutters tend to cut more cleanly, giving a better rise) and dip it into some flour.
Plunge into the dough and repeat until you have four scones.
Press what’s left of the dough back into a round to cut out another four.
Brush the tops with beaten egg, then place them onto the hot baking tray.</li>

<li>Bake for 10 minutes until risen and golden on the top.</li>

<li>Eat warm or cold on the day of baking, generously topped with jam and clotted cream.</li>
<li>If freezing:

Freeze once cool. Defrost, then put in a low oven (about 160°C) for a few minutes to refresh.</li></ol>
